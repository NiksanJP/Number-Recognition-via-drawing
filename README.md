# Number-Recognition-via-drawing
This program is a Machine learning program that uses Tensorflow with Keras models. This ML program is trained using the MNIST dataset. Unfortunately the MNIST dataset does not give real life images and the trained model is not good enough for real life images.

# Pre-Requisits
You will need:
1. Tensorflow 2.0a
2. Pygame 1.9.3+
3. Matplotlib
4. Pillow
5. OpenCV

# Installation
	pip install tensorflow==2.0.0-alpha0
	pip install pygame
	pip install matplotlib
	pip install pillow
	pip install OpenCV
	
# How to Use
Open numberRecognition.py

# Other files
There are sample images of numbers as Converted.png and number.png. Others are Tensorflow training checkpoints and training data.
